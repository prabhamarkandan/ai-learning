## How AI Agents Work in Practice

1. **Train the AI Agent:**  
   Provide your use case, data, and playbook to tailor the AI's capabilities to your specific needs. Input data such as transcripts, call recordings, invoices, qualification criteria, and key objectives for accurate adaptation.

2. **Configure Workflows and Integrations:**  
   Align the AI agent with your existing tools and processes. Set up seamless integrations with CRMs, calendars, and business systems, while defining actions, alerts, and escalation protocols that match your teamâ€™s requirements.

3. **Deploy and Manage Operations:**  
   Launch the AI agent to handle operations autonomously. Track its performance through real-time metrics, evaluate outcomes, and refine processes to achieve optimal results.

*AI Agents will handle the routine tasks while flagging opportunities for your team.*
